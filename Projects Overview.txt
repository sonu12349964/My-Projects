Azure Capstone Project:
===================
Here is a brief overview for Azure Capstone Project;


In this project, a network infrastructure is designed with four virtual machines (VMs) spread across two separate Virtual Networks (VNETs).
These VNETs are interconnected using Peering, enabling communication between the VMs while maintaining network isolation.
Additionally, each VNET is equipped with its own Application Gateway, providing advanced load balancing capabilities.

Furthermore, a Traffic Manager is implemented to efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across all four VMs, ensuring optimal 
performance and high availability. this setup enhances the overall network reliability, scalability, and security by utilizing Azure's robust networking 
features, facilitating seamless communication and load distribution for the deployed applications.

AWS Capstone Projects:
==================
Here is a brief explanation which you can use to describe the projects done:

Project 1 – Deploying a Multi-Tier Website using AWS EC2 with Amazon RDS:

In Project 1, we successfully deployed a Multi-Tier Website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances along with 
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).This project was a testament to our expertise in designing and implementing a scalable and reliable 
web infrastructure.We utilized AWS EC2 for hosting our web application, leveraging its resizable compute capacity in the cloud to ensure seamless 
performance.

Additionally, we integrated Amazon RDS, a managed relational database service, into our architecture.
This allowed us to establish a robust database tier, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.
By configuring virtual servers, load balancers, and databases, and integrating RDS, we achieved optimal performance, security, and scalability for our 
website.The inclusion of Amazon RDS enhanced the reliability of our database operations, contributing to the overall success of the project.

Project 2 – Publishing Amazon SNS Messages Privately with VPC Endpoint:

In Project 2, we focused on the secure publication of messages using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), ensuring private communication channels.
To enhance the security of our messaging system, we implemented a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoint.
This VPC endpoint allowed private and direct access to SNS without traversing the public internet, enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of our 
messages. By leveraging this advanced networking feature, we established a secure communication pathway between our application and SNS, mitigating 
the risks associated with public internet communication.

This project not only demonstrated our expertise in secure messaging but also highlighted our commitment to adopting advanced networking solutions, 
ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data transmissions.

DevOps Capstone Projects:
=====================
Project 1: Application Deployment Using CI/CD Tools
Implemented a git workflow architecture and used Jenkins jobs to deploy a container on specific ports for
different branches, including the develop branch for testing the Dockerfile, the master branch for testing
the final version of the Dockerfile, and the production server for the final release of the product. The
process was automated using Jenkins, Git, and Docker.

Project2: Deployment of Application using Orchestration, containerization, and IAC Tools
Automated containerized application deployment using Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
Built the cloud infrastructure in AWS, configuring servers with Configuration Management tools, and
implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins. Used Kubernetes to create clusters and services,
containerizing application with Dockerfile, and adhering to git workflow architecture.
